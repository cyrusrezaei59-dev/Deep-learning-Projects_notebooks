# Deep Learning projects Notebooks

This repository contains a small collection of Jupyter notebooks (HW1â€“HW6). They are organized under `notebooks/` and saved without outputs for a cleaner Git history.


## What's inside
- HW1.ipynb
- HW2.ipynb
- HW3_21_22.ipynb
- HW4.ipynb
- HW5_21_22.ipynb
- HW6_21_22.ipynb


## Getting started
```bash
# Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv .venv
# On macOS/Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate
# On Windows (PowerShell):
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Launch Jupyter
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=math-homeworks
jupyter notebook
```

## Notes
- The notebooks have had their outputs cleared to reduce file sizes.
- If any datasets are needed, place them under a local `data/` folder (ignored by Git).
